# wallpapr

Gets random photos from [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com/) and sets them as the desktop background.
Works on Debian operating systems select operating systems (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint), at least for now.

## Requirements

In addition to having `go` installed to your system, you'll also need an Unsplash Developers Account
for you to get an unsplash access key to be used for API calls under the hood.
Proceed to [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) and create an account.
After creating an account, create an app. You'll get the app's access key towards the bottom of the 
created app's page.
